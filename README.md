# NetApiDocker
.NET 6 API with Docker

This is a default .NET 6 API that I created to generate dockerfile, build the image and put into a container.
Then I push the image to my docker hub.

The instructions file has the steps that I made and some docker commands.

Docker command to check the images: docker image ls
